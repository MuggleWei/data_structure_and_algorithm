# data structure and algorithm

## Introduction

This repo contain some data structure and algorithm with benchmark write in c/c++. The purpose of this repo is to practise theory, can work and fast run is main target.

This repo can be used in some special case rather than common use. For example, when DATA_STRUCTURE_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION is enable, I prepare a memory pool in some data structure, but this memory pool grow up and will not shrink, destroyed until the data structure object was destroyed. In most situation, it's sound bad, but in vedio game or something efficiency is the key, it work well.
